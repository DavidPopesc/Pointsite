## Pointsite and what it does

Welcome to PointSite!
This is a simple website that allows users to sign in and send, receive, and shop using "points"! Points are like a virtual currency that users have.

## Create your own pointsite

Want to set this up for you to be able to send points to your family and friends! Feel free to set up your own server! Download the project, do "npm run dev", feel free to edit the project to your sepecifications!

Deploy it on Vercel to make it easier for you! Or don't. I don't mind either way
